# Competitive programming

In this repository, I solve some classical problems from competitive programming. That helps me evolve both as a software developper and as a computer scientist, besides enhancing my problem solving ability. The mc521 and mc621 folders have several contests I did through life and roadmap_neetcode has problems from a specific roadmap focused in coding interviews.
