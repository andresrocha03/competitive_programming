#problem: Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
#sol: use two pointers to expand around the center of the palindrome. For each character in the string, we consider it as the center of a potential palindrome.

class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # odd length
            l, r = i, i
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                res += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # even length
            l, r = i, i + 1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                res += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

        return res
